    "The pipeline used the helper functions with little modification, except for the following:\n",
    "1. Added a extrapolate_line function that allows to fit a 1-d polynomial line through all the x,y coordinates passed as an argument (array of lines). The function traces a line between the bottom of the image and 3/5 of the height. The return of the function is a single line defined by an x,y pair.\n",
    "2. Modified the draw_lines function to segregate the 'left' and 'right' lines based on slope, and using a minimum slope of +-0.2 to reduce some noise. The extrapolate_line function is called for this 2 lines, and the function returns the image with the 2 'straight' lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the pipeline are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trasnformed the image to gray scale and applied gaussian blur to reduce noise\n",
    "2. Applied canny edge detection, and kept the resulting images to an area (region of interest). For the region of interest I used a triangle shape with vertices at both bottom ends and mid-point, that correspond closer to the zone delimeted by the driving lines.\n",
    "3. Used a Hough transform function to get the edges from step 2 to line representations, and applied the extrapolation function to create straight line that fit through hough points, and extend close to the area of interest.\n",
    "4. Overlayed the lines from step 3 to the original image.\n",

    "1. Pipeline worked very well with the 2 test videos, but I didn't provide a good solution for the challenge video. See improvement to Pipeline \n",
    "2. During video compilation got some errors due to 0-lenght arrays mostly when no lines where detected on some frames. Will need to modify functions to account for this type of exceptions.\n",
    "3. The area of interest and extension of edge lines have been hard-coded to specific values to satisfy the project. Current pipeline might not work with video that falls out this parameters."
